# Is this JAR an OSGi bundle?

How many times are we caught by doubt and fears, wondering: is this JAR file an OSGi bundle! Doubts no more, though! This project will check that for you. "Is this JAR an OSGi bundle?" (aka itjaob) checks that for you. Just [go there](http://itjaob.glitch.me/)  and give the link (or Maven identification) of your JAR file! If you need an OSGi bundle (regardless of what it does) get a OSGi-ready file from the [list of checked JARs](http://itjaob.glitch.me/all).
